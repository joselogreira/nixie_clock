## Getting Started

There're many good designs out there in the wilderness. To the point of this writting I've lost track of most of them, but they are not hard to find. 

I think this design includes some intresting tradeoffs worth looking, and some very neat hardware and software artifacts that give this project a plus.

My interest is __NOT__ to fully document the work done, but to __highlight__ some key points that aren't easy to figure out.

+ Head over to the left navigation menu and explore some of them
+ Or jump right into the [source](https://github.com/joselogreira/nixie_clock) to look under the hood.
+ Read through the [README.md](https://github.com/joselogreira/nixie_clock/blob/master/README.md) file for a quick description of the toolchain used for programming.

___ENJOY!___
