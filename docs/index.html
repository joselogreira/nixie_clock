              <p class="lead">
                <a href="https://nuvitron.com/nixie-tubes-made/">Nixie tubes</a> were popular like 40 years ago. Used in military-grade equipment, these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_cathode">cold cathode</a> tubes were some of the first technologies used for displays. There's quite a bit of <a href="https://nuvitron.com/nixie-tubes-made/">low vacuum science</a> involved, and require operation voltages that may seem insane for today's electronic devices: say 160 volts.
              </p>
              <p class="lead">
                Tubes come in different flavours. The one used here is the reference <a href="http://www.tube-tester.com/sites/nixie/data/in-12a.htm"> IN-12</a>. Take a few of these, arrange them nicely and <i>voil√†!</i>, you have a Nixie Clock. Why do they matter today? 'cuz they look <strong>awesome!</strong>. No, seriously, because their unique vintage look generates an exceptional contrast with today's modern aesthetic; and because the excercise of using modern hobby electronics to make them glow is a challenge worth taking.

            <h3 class="text-center">Simple 8-bits MCU</h3>
            <p>
              From the AVR family, 32KB Flash and 2KB RAM is all that's needed to pack a lot of features, besides including a fair amount of peripheral timers to synchronize all time-critical tasks. Easily programmable via cheap third-party programmers and using the AVR linux toolchain.

            <h3 class="text-center">No external RTC needed</h3>
            <p>
              The MCU includes a built-in RTC peripheral, and the whole CPU is able to run at voltages as low as 1.8V, thus, allowing the use of coin cells as back-up power and simplifying the overall design.

            <h3 class="text-center">Fully customizable</h3>
            <p>
              Code already includes many features such as RGB LED color variation routines, song themes for use with the alarm, built-in functional test, serial debug port, brightness levels variation, among others.
